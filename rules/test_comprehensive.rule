# Comprehensive test demonstrating TRUE, FALSE, and UNDETERMINED states

# Rule 1: A is fact, makes B true
A => B

# Rule 2: C makes (D | E) - D and E become undetermined
C => D | E

# Rule 3: F makes (G ^ H) - G and H become undetermined (exactly one is true)
F => G ^ H

# Rule 4: X has no supporting rules, will be FALSE
X + Y => Z

# Facts
=A      # A is explicitly true
=C      # C is explicitly true
=F      # F is explicitly true
!Y      # Y is explicitly false

# Queries
?A      # TRUE (fact)
?B      # TRUE (from A => B)
?C      # TRUE (fact)
?D      # UNDETERMINED (from C => D | E)
?E      # UNDETERMINED (from C => D | E)
?F      # TRUE (fact)
?G      # UNDETERMINED (from F => G ^ H)
?H      # UNDETERMINED (from F => G ^ H)
?X      # FALSE (no evidence)
?Y      # FALSE (negative fact)
?Z      # FALSE (depends on X which is false)
