# MULTIPLE AND OPERATORS

# Rules
D + E + F => G  # D and E and F implies G

# Facts
=DEF            # D is True, E is True, F is True

# Queries
?G              # What is the value of G?

# Result
# Query: G
# Rule that concludes G: D and E and F implies G
#   Subgoals: D, E, F
#       D: Fact says D is True
#       E: Fact says E is True
#       F: Fact says F is True
#   Subgoals: D and E and F
#       Subgoal: D and E
#           D and E is True + True = True
#       Subgoal: (D and E) and F
#           (D and E) and F is True + True = True
#       Since (D and E) and F is True then D and E and F is True
#   Since D and E and F is True then G is True
# Result G is True
