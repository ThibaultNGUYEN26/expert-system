# UNDEFINED AND OPERATOR

# Rules
H + I => J  # H and I implies J

# Facts
=H          # H is True

# Queries
?J          # What is the value of J?

# Result
# Query: J
# Rule that concludes J: H and I implies J
#   Subgoals: H, I
#       H: Fact says H is True
#       I: Undetermined
#   Subgoal: H and I
#       H and I is True + Undetermined = Undetermined since I is Undetermined
#   Since H and I is Undetermined then J is Undetermined
# Result J is Undetermined
