# Rules
K + L => M  # K and L implies M

# Facts
# Facts
=KZ          # K is True and INIT Z
Z => !L      # Move negative fact into rule

# Queries
?M          # What is the value of M?

# Result
# Query: M
# Rule that concludes M: K and L implies M
#   Subgoals: K, L
#       K: Fact says K is True
#       L: Fact says Not L is True → therefore L is False
#   Subgoal: K and L
#       K and L is True + False = False
#   Since K and L is False then M is False
# Result M is False
