# NOT AND OPERATOR

# Rules
K + L => M  # K and L implies M

# Facts
=K          # K is True
!L          # Not L is True

# Queries
?M          # What is the value of M?

# Result
# Query: M
# Rule that concludes M: K and L implies M
#   Subgoals: H, I
#       H: Fact says I is True
#       I: Undetermined
#   Subgoal: H and I
#       H and I is Undetermined since I is Undetermined
#   Since H and I is Undetermined then G is Undetermined
# Result G is Undetermined
