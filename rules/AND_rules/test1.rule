# SIMPLE AND OPERATOR

# Rules
A + (B ^ C) => D  # A and B implies C

# Facts
=AB         # A is True, B is True
!C

# Queries
?D          # What is the value of C?

# Result
# Query: C
# Rule that concludes C: A and B implies C
#   Subgoals: A, B
#       A: Fact says A is True
#       B: Fact says B is True
#   Subgoal: A and B
#       A and B is True + True = True
#   Since A and B is True then C is True
# Result C is True
