# SIMPLE XOR OPERATOR

# Rules
A ^ B => C  # A xor B implies C

# Facts
=AB         # A is True, B is True

# Queries
?C          # What is the value of C?

# Result
# Query: C
# Rule that concludes C: A and B implies C
#   Subgoals: A, B
#       A: Fact says A is True
#       B: Fact says B is True
#   Subgoal: A xor B
#       A xor B is True ^ True = False
#   Since A xor B is False then C is False
# Result C is False
