# UNDEFINED XOR OPERATOR

# Rules
H ^ I => J  # H xor I implies J

# Facts
=H          # H is True

# Queries
?J          # What is the value of J?

# Result
# Query: J
# Rule that concludes J: H xor I implies J
#   Subgoals: H, I
#       H: Fact says H is True
#       I: Undetermined
#   Subgoal: H xor I
#       H xor I is True ^ Undetermined = Undetermined
#   Since H xor I is Undetermined then J is Undetermined
# Result J is Undetermined
