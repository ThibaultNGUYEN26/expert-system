# NOT OR OPERATOR

# Rules
K | L => M  # K or L implies M

# Facts
=K          # K is True
!L          # Not L is True (so L is False)

# Queries
?M          # What is the value of M?

# Result
# Query: M
# Rule that concludes M: K or L implies M
#   Subgoals: K, L
#       K: Fact says K is True
#       L: Fact says Not L is True → therefore L is False
#   Subgoal: K or L
#       K or L is True | False = True
#   Since K or L is True then M is True
# Result M is True
