# MULTIPLE OR OPERATORS

# Rules
D | E | F => G  # D or E or F implies G

# Facts
=DEF            # D is True, E is True, F is True

# Queries
?G              # What is the value of G?

# Result
# Query: G
# Rule that concludes G: D or E or F implies G
#   Subgoals: D, E, F
#       D: Fact says D is True
#       E: Fact says E is True
#       F: Fact says F is True
#   Subgoals: D or E or F
#       Subgoal: D or E
#           D or E is True | True = True
#       Subgoal: (D or E) or F
#           (D or E) or F is True | True = True
#       Since (D or E) or F is True then D or E or F is True
#   Since D or E or F is True then G is True
# Result G is True
