H | I => J  # H or I implies J

# Facts
=H          # H is True

# Queries

# Rule that concludes J: H or I implies J
#   Subgoals: H, I
#       H: Fact says H is True
#       I: Undetermined
#   Subgoal: H or I
#       H or I is True | Undetermined = True
#   Since H or I is True then J is True
# Result J is True
